# Apollo Compiler

## What is it?

Apollo is nothing more than a simple compiler I'm writing in my free time as a way to learn more about compilers, Rust, and many more cool things.

I have very little idea what the final language will end up looking like, or if it ever ends up being finished to any reasonable extent. The initial goal is to get some kind of C-like language compiling for x86_64 with a decent number of middle-end optimisations and a decent quiality of codegen, and then see from there.

## How to build

Very simple: just clone the code and `cargo run` to try it out!
